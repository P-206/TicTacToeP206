# TicTacToeP206
*The game tick tack toe from P206*

## Project content
- **Build.java** (Builds the world and contains variables that game.java has access to)
- **Game.java** (Contains the main logic for the game)
- **TicTacToeTest.java** (Contains the tests we've built to make sure the programs runs accordingly)
- **build.gradle** (The gradle build file that we used)

##Programming rules
Java

- **1. Classes**
Classes are written in upper camel casing, where the fyrst letter in the word is capitalized.
*Example: UpperCamelCasing.

- **2. Functions**
Functions are written in lower camel casing, where the first letter in the word is lower case.
*Example: camelCasing

-- **3. General**
We used K&R indent style where a curly bracket is inserted after a statement and below the contents on the statement. Everything within a statement is indented for each curly bracket used.
*Example:
*public static void play(){
*	do{
*		play(Build.turn);
*	}while(!Build.gameOver);
*}
