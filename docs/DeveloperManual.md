# Developer Manual

## Introduction
This TicTacToe game is developed by P-206. The group used Test-Driven-Development also know as TDD and we recommend that developers that want to be able to use our product to understand how it works. Developers should have basic understanding in Java.
## Software Requirements
It is required for the TicTacToe to work properly is to use these software.
* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
* [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html)

## Getting Started

## Using GitHub

## Markdown documentation
In this report we will present to you a documentation of our project in Software Engineering. The assingment stated that using Markdown would deliver us a extra point, we also found that the plain document texting made project goals, vision and all around devolopement clear.

##### Project infrastructure
In the project we followed the assingment's instructions, some of them included:
  - Good design practices
  - Loosely coupled code
  - Store the code base on GitHub
  - Used Test Driven Develpement for the business logic

##### Access our assingment
Our project can be accessed through GitHub with the following command:

```sh
$ git clone [https://github.com/P-206/TicTacToeP206.git] 
```

##### Coding and project development
The assingment features a few extra points teams can get. We sought-after few of those including using automated continuous integration server, the Teacher recommended using Travis and so we did.
Travis automates triggering a build and test upon each integration and makes detection of a potential integration bug easier.


##### Todos
Some of the thing's we would have wanted to feature or implement are:
 - Write Tests
 - Rethink Github Save
 - Add Code Comments
 - Add Night Mode
